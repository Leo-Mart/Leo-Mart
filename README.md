## Hi there 👋

I'm Martin Leo, a newly minted developer from Sweden. 
I've been working with a few different languages over the last couple of years, such as Javascript/Typescript, Go and Java. So far Go is my preferred language. 

### Here is some stuff I've built:
- [WoWTracker](https://github.com/Leo-Mart/Exam-Goth-Stack)
- [Portfolio-site](https://github.com/Leo-Mart/NextJS_Portfolio)
- [WordGuess](https://github.com/Leo-Mart/WordGuess)

### And I am currently doing:
- I'm currently learning more about Go, Python, backend-development, and more through [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/)
